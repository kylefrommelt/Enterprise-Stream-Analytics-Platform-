# Real-Time Streaming Analytics Pipeline Project

## Project Overview

This project implements a complete production-grade real-time streaming analytics pipeline using modern data engineering technologies. It demonstrates how to build a scalable, resilient, and maintainable data platform that can process and analyze high-volume streaming data in real-time.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer
- **Apache Kafka**: Central messaging bus for all streaming data
- **Schema Registry**: Manages Avro schemas for data compatibility
- **Kafka Connect**: Connects external systems to Kafka

### 2. Stream Processing Layer
- **Apache Spark Streaming**: Processes streaming data in real-time
- **Delta Lake**: Provides ACID transactions on data lake storage
- **MinIO (S3-compatible)**: Object storage for the data lake

### 3. Orchestration Layer
- **Apache Airflow**: Orchestrates workflows and schedules jobs
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores metadata and processed aggregations

### 4. Monitoring and Observability Layer
- **Data Quality Monitoring**: Validates data against schema and business rules
- **Service Monitoring**: Tracks health and performance of services
- **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics and dashboards

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing, building, and deployment
- **Docker**: Containerizes all services for consistency
- **Kubernetes**: Deployment environment (referenced in CI/CD, not included in code)

## Key Features

### Data Ingestion
- Highly scalable Kafka streaming with partitioning
- Schema validation with Avro and Schema Registry
- Support for multiple data sources (user activity, IoT sensors, transactions)

### Real-time Processing
- Exactly-once semantics for reliable processing
- Low-latency stream processing with Spark Structured Streaming
- Windowed aggregations for time-series analysis
- Multiple output sinks (Delta Lake, PostgreSQL)

### Data Quality and Monitoring
- Comprehensive data quality checks (null values, ranges, anomalies)
- Real-time alerting to Slack and email
- Service health monitoring
- Performance metrics collection and visualization

### Scalability and Reliability
- Horizontally scalable architecture
- Fault-tolerant processing with checkpointing
- Transaction support with Delta Lake
- Containerized deployment for consistent environments

### CI/CD and DevOps
- Automated linting and testing
- Validation of configuration files
- Containerized builds
- Continuous deployment to development and production environments

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow
1. **Data Generation**: Simulated data sources produce events to Kafka topics
2. **Stream Processing**: Spark Streaming jobs process the data in real-time
3. **Data Storage**: Processed data is stored in Delta Lake and PostgreSQL
4. **Data Quality**: Continuous monitoring ensures data quality
5. **Visualization**: Dashboards display real-time metrics and KPIs
