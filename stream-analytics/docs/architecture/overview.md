# Stream Analytics Pipeline Architecture

## Overview
The Stream Analytics Pipeline is a real-time data processing system that ingests, processes, and analyzes user activity data. The system is built with scalability, reliability, and observability in mind.

## System Components

### 1. Data Ingestion
- **Kafka**: Message broker for event streaming
- **Data Generator**: Simulates user activity events
- **Schema Validation**: Ensures data quality at ingestion

### 2. Stream Processing
- **Spark Streaming**: Real-time data processing
- **Data Quality Checks**: Validation and cleaning
- **Anomaly Detection**: Statistical analysis for anomalies

### 3. Data Storage
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary data store
- **Tables**:
  - `user_activity`: Raw event data
  - `hourly_metrics`: Aggregated metrics
  - `data_quality_checks`: Quality check results
  - `anomaly_detection_results`: Anomaly detection results
  - `dashboard_metadata`: Dashboard state

### 4. Orchestration
- **Airflow**: Workflow management
- **DAGs**: Pipeline orchestration
- **Task Dependencies**: Data flow management

### 5. Monitoring & Alerting
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards
- **Alertmanager**: Alert routing and management

## Data Flow

1. **Event Generation**
   - User activity events are generated
   - Events are validated against schema
   - Events are published to Kafka

2. **Stream Processing**
   - Events are consumed from Kafka
   - Data quality checks are performed
   - Anomaly detection is applied
   - Results are stored in PostgreSQL

3. **Metrics Collection**
   - Processing metrics are collected
   - System health metrics are monitored
   - Alerts are triggered when thresholds are exceeded

4. **Visualization**
   - Real-time dashboards show system state
   - Historical trends are analyzed
   - Performance metrics are tracked

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics
- Event processing rates
- Error rates and types
- Processing latency
- Queue sizes
- System resource usage

### Alerts
- High error rates
- Processing delays
- Queue buildup
- System health issues

### Dashboards
- Real-time event processing
- Error monitoring
- Performance metrics
- System health status

## Scalability & Reliability

### Horizontal Scaling
- Kafka partitions for parallel processing
- Spark workers for distributed processing
- PostgreSQL read replicas

### Fault Tolerance
- Message replay capabilities
- Checkpointing for state recovery
- Error handling and retries
- Circuit breakers for external services

### Data Consistency
- Transaction management
- Data validation
- Schema versioning
- Backup and recovery procedures
